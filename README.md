In this exploration, I followed a simple tutorial on how to write a
packet analyzer/sniffer. I believe this is very useful for web
development as well as something that will be important for the
career path that I am hoping to follow.

edit: sudo needs to be used since raw sockets are made, and scapy needs to be installed

To run, type "sudo python packetsniffer.py"

edit:

mysocket.py is a different version and works better: to run use
"sudo python mysocket.py"
